# Problem

**Union Find** algorithm that I often has to write from scratch myself for [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) solutions. I have seen Union Find being implemented in a form of `struct` or `class` instead of inline functions with two arrays. This project exists so one can quickly copy-and-paste a `UnionFind` data structure to a [Swift] Leetcode solutions.
